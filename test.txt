peoples get married in Ethiopia is deffrent places. some of them in the court,some of the park and the rest of the church. so i think depends of the bride and groom interest and preference.
like is said the bride and groom cloths depands of their preference and the place the get married. for instance when the place is  church the wear Kaba or the place is in the park they wear Vialo.
I think for marrage there is no age lemitation. if they think that they are ready to marrage both mentaly and finncially ,They can to marrage. I think the requiremnt of marrage is the most important is not age but commetiment. but i recomment if some one who is around 30 to 40 age and fulfile the above requirment is the good time to marrage.
